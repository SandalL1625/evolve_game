It`s a simple evolution simulation made on python with using Pygame and MatPlotLib.
Cells can eat food and each other. 
Every generation inherits mutations from parents and with a small chanse changes them. 
Mutations are coordinate planes: x is speed/energy reserve, y is predator/behavior. 
On grafic red line is y, blue line is x. x axis is food per second.
Every spawned food degreases time to spawn next food.
